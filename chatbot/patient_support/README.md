## Important Notes

- This chatbot is designed for general health information only

## API Documentation

Once running, visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for interactive API documentation powered by FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"RAG system disabled"**: No PDFs in docs/ folder or loading failed
2. **Slow responses**: Large documents or many PDFs - consider optimization
3. **Memory errors**: Reduce document size or increase system memory
4. **API key errors**: Check your Gemini API key configuration

### Performance Tips

- Keep PDFs under 10MB each for optimal performance
- Use clear, well-structured medical documents
- Regularly clear conversation memory for fresh starts
- Monitor document loading in startup logs
